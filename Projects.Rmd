## Physics Club Website 
<br/>

#### Description:

Used `ReactJS`, `HTML`, and `CSS`, to create an interactive website for the schools physics club, which included important information about club activities, as well as an embeded sign up form which facilitated 30+ students to join the club. Creatively employed `EmailJS`, a back-end service which allowed me to create a responsive form that passed user
feedback straight into the clubs email inbox.
